# UNU MAP - NASA CHALLENGE

## CHALLENGE
**What's Up With This Water?**
Have you ever been swimming in a natural body of water and felt curious about the microscopic and larger life all around you, or what else is living in the water? There is a vast amount of life in oceans, rivers, and lakes—most of which cannot be seen with our eyes! Your challenge is to create an app that notifies people of endangered species in the bodies of water around them, explains what they can do to help preserve those species, and informs them how to use the water for recreation in a respectful way.

## HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY
**UNU MAP** is a web application that contains an interactive map where locations of endangered aquatic animals are marked, providing specific information about their name, scientific name, habitat, location, description, care, and an augmented reality view of the animal. This project aims to raise awareness through exploration of the Earth’s bodies of water about which aquatic animal species are in danger of becoming extinct. Our goal is to provide information and generate awareness in people about the care and protection of aquatic animals. We will keep the information updated with the help of our partner and ambassadors who will be in different parts of the world. With this, we can restore what has been damaged on our planet and reconnect with its beauty and fragility.

## PROJECT DEMO
**Presentation:** [UNU MAP Presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFwsNXxG5w/5Z3EsjSR0XOi291HgOxUyA/view?utm_content=DAFwsNXxG5w&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelin)

## FINAL PROJECT
Load your complete final project on an external site (a cloud-based hosting service or a code repository, for example, YouTube, Google Drive, GitHub, One Drive, Dropbox, etc., if your project used code) and provide a public access link. The link you provide should not require a password, permission, or registration to access your final project.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**What exactly does it do?**
UNU MAP application displays an interactive map showing endangered animals in bodies of water at a certain location. The map provides relevant information about each of these animals, and also offers the option to view the animal in 3D using augmented reality.

**How does it work?**
Through the interactive map, markers will be placed at specific locations representing an endangered animal. Each marker will have a pop-up window that provides information about the animal, the rating of the information, the date, and the author. In this pop-up window, there will be a button that allows you to view a 3D animated model of the animal through a smartphone. This model can be seen in any real environment through the device’s camera. In addition, when interacting with the animal, a voice will provide important information about the animal and the actions that people can take to prevent its extinction. At the end of the window, the user will have the option to rate the information provided. This allows for a dynamic and educational interaction with the application.

**What are the benefits?**
The application will increase public awareness about the importance of conserving biodiversity and the need to protect aquatic ecosystems and their inhabitants. By informing people about the presence of endangered species into bodies of water, it motivates people to drive conservation efforts. This includes the adoption of sustainable management practices and the implementation of specific protection measures for these habitats.
Likewise, the application can allow scientists and conservationists to collect data on the distribution and status of endangered species populations. This information is valuable for decision-making in conservation management.
Finally, education in schools about endangered animals would be developed in a more dynamic and fun way.

**What do we hope to achieve?**
We hope to raise awareness about endangered marine animals in order to safeguard the biodiversity that bodies of water possess around the world.

**What tools, coding languages, hardware, or software did you use to develop your project?**
- Web tools: PLAYCANVAS, Canvas, Pixelcup, PineTools, Narakeet
- Framework: Django
- Programming languages: Python, JavaScript
- Libraries: Bootstrap, MapBox
- Hardware: Motorola Edge 20 Pro for 3D model visualization, computers with Windows and Linux operating systems

## USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
At the moment we only use a voice reader (Narakeet) that uses artificial intelligence to generate audio. We believe that our problem could be solved with more traditional and simple methods, without resorting to complex or costly algorithms. Our solution is based on data analysis, research, and the creativity of our team. However, the use of artificial intelligence is considered to improve the application, for example to determine which are the most important contributions based on the ratings obtained in the web application.
